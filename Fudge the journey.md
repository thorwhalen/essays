# Fudge the journey

It’s about the journey?

Fudge the journey. I’m in it for the destination. 

I don’t enjoy running. I enjoy having run.

I’m not in it for the process, it’s the result I’m after.

It’s as if I expected god-like powers allowing me to think and my thoughts be done, 
and find any delay between both unacceptable. 
Imagine therefore my frustration with the state of technology today, a day whose year bears the deceivingly pretentious number of 2020. 
Sure, we carry supercomputing portals to the universe in our pockets, but “can you hear me now” is the expected state of tele-communication. 

And don’t get me started on coding. We created computers; shouldn’t *that* give us god-like powers over it? 
Since we (or someone of our species) decided every aspect of what a computer does and how it does it, 
shouldn’t we be able to make it so that our will be done, now. Or at least soon? 

No.

Okay, if someone else packaged our desires in an easy-to-use app, we can achieve near-god-speeds on a specific task, 
but what if you want to actually be creative and do something that doesn’t fall into a general category of tasks covered by an app?

Instead of making computers that understand what we want, we’ve made them so that a human needs to spend time learning a new language, 
and possibly needs to learn about the anatomy and psychology of the machine. 
Only after this unnatural rite of passage is our hero allowed to step into the hell of actually trying to bring into existence an idea, 
and god forbid they let let an extra comma enter the conversation, or a semi-comma go missing; 
even one such small variation could make the difference between something and nothing at all.

And this is by design, because I’d like to remind you, we (or someone from our species) *designed it that way*.
