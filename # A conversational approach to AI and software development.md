## Conversing with data

The current success of deep learning is deserved, but in my opinion has a few undesirable effects, 
amongst which is this obsession with removing the human from the process. 
An alternative approach would be to work on making tools that would allow the human to have a conversation with the data 
rather than **only** try create a direct connection between data and machine that bypasses us. 

I agree on the many pros, and the wonderful horizons, of having the machine be able to learn independently; 
I just think that something is lost, and what is lost doesn't get much coverage. 
Yes, we hear of "blackbox", we hear of the "interpretability" limitations of deep learning, but it goes further than that. 
Our approach doesn't allow us to effectively communicate our own thought patterns or data-locked-up-in-our-experience to the machine, 
nor for the machine to help us ask questions about the data beyond the perspectives it was trained to extract from it. 

## Optimizing the machine+human system

Perhaps we need to include the human in the equation and optimize the machine+human(+data?) system.

Let me start with this. I use the term AI or ML because it’s understood, but the direction I’m inspired towards is not endowing machines with independence, but rather **optimizing the machine+human system to enhance human creativity and productivity**. 
It’s not a new idea, but I find that current trends lose sight of that – with their black box big data models, programming languages that reflect how the machine works more than how our thoughts work, the lack of harnessing uncertainty, etc. 

Some problems have clear, fixed and measurable objectives. For instance self-driving cars need to be able to drive you from A to B without hurting anyone or destroying anything. With the right sensors and enough data it seems plausible that we'll be able to rely on deep learning to solve that problem. 

But what if the problem itself is not as well defined. Say, helping a person implement and idea. 
I can have such a clear idea of an app in my head, and might even be able to
communicate this to a developer in a few minutes, effectively enough that they can go off and develop it with 
little or no further interaction on my part. 
Yet that implementing the idea takes days, weeks, or even months.
Why is that?

## Coding at the speed of thought

The lag from idea to implementation is frustratingly too large to facilitate creativity and adaptivity.  

I'm fortunate enough to have a reached a level of experience that allows me to express at least some of my thoughts directly in the form of code, as long as it's something I'm familiar enough with that I know the vocabulary (and grammar) I need to 
talk to the machine with. 

As soon as I need to deal with details that I can't express as quickly as I'm thinking them, things slow down, 
the global vision is blurred and the momentum is lost. 
On a good design day, I'm able to write things in layers that are each simple enough to express a part of 
the larger idea but not every day is a good design day.

I'm human. Yet I'm shaping my mind according to the way the machine operates.
Shouldn't the machine be endowed with some, say, minimal intelligence that it takes to help me along the path from 
idea to implementation? 

Is it too much to ask?

## Hopes on the horizon

I'm not alone. 

Others recognize the problem and some are providing elements to the solution. 
From programming paradigms 
(see for example "[Declarative vs imperative](https://dev.to/ruizb/declarative-vs-imperative-4a7l)") 
to AI-enabled IDEs such as [copilot](https://copilot.github.com/), 
there is hope!

I'm a contributor to a github organization called [i2mint](https://github.com/i2mint) 
whose goal is to participate in this "idea-to-implementation" effort,
in the form of packages that aim at simplifying specific aspects of software development boilerplate
such as accessing and preparing data, joining code components into systems, creating web-service and UIs, etc.
