# (we shouldn't have to) Mind the machine
I've always been frustrated at how tedious getting from an idea to its implementation could be. 
Though we've made some progress since machine language, we're still haunted by it's legacy: 
"coding" is still too close to the metal. We need to shape our ideas as required by how a machine works 
-- rather than the machine/language being able to adapt to the shape of our ideas. 

# Reduce vocabulary entropy
One way to get to enable faster development is to have tools that vocabulary entropy. 

Every time I try to use a new package, I scour through the documentation to figure out how to... And I use my words. 
But the package author used hers. 

How do I read a row in sql? How do I read to a json file? How do I get the contents of a github repository? How do I download the contents that a url is pointing at? 

Read, load, get, download, ... The words we use or endless. And those were the simple common words. When you get into specifics, it gets worse. And the time-to-implementation is pushed back. 
And once you figured out what a particular package calls a particular thing, you'll forget if you didn't use it 
recently.

We don't want to have to think about how every specific source calls a read, or a size, 
or a time to pause before reads, or what format THAT particular sensor is encoding it's data in, 
having you shuffle through documentation pages before you can figure out how to start doing the fun stuff, 
which happens to be the stuff that actually produces value. And, oh, once you figure it out, 
if you don't use it for a few months or years, next time you need to do something similar, 
you'll have to figure it all out again.

If instead, we had the tools to quickly and consistently wrap around a new package, offering us a consistent words 
for similar actions, it'd be easier wouldn't it.

# Code-facing AI

We have grand AI dreams, but the idea of applying AI to helping the coding process out seems to be uncommon. 

Yet, we will reach AI heights through our communication with the machine. 

If we can't improve that communication, what other grandeur could we hope for?!

Perhaps this is the exponential-creating feedback-loop we've been missing: The human helping the machine to help the human help the machine...
