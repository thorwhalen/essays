# (we shouldn't have to) Mind the machine
I've always been frustrated at how tedious getting from an idea to its implementation could be. 
Though we've made some progress since machine language, we're still haunted by it's legacy: 
"coding" is still too close to the metal. We need to shape our ideas as required by how a machine works 
-- rather than the machine/language being able to adapt to the shape of our ideas. 

# Reduce vocabulary entropy
One way we do this is by reducing the vocabulary entropy: 
We don't want to have to think about how every specific source calls a read, or a size, 
or a time to pause before reads, or what format THAT particular sensor is encoding it's data in, 
having you shuffle through documentation pages before you can figure out how to start doing the fun stuff, 
which happens to be the stuff that actually produces value. And, oh, once you figure it out, 
if you don't use it for a few months or years, next time you need to do something similar, 
you'll have to figure it all out again.
