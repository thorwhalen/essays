There’s a career to be made in specializing in S-curves.

Everyone says “exponential” so easily, and many act according to an exponential-based forecast.

But exponential growth doesn’t exist, except locally (assuming the universe can be considered finite for all practical purposes).
An exponential curve is **always** an S-curve in disguise, an S-curve seen myopically, like the flatness illusion of an earthling.

So being able to estimate when the curve will bend and the illusion of exponential will cease, is a great advantage.

# Coresets ML career

Weighted points and other *operable* compressions of datasets. 

Techniques to compress datasets in a way that standard ML methods can be applied to them with minimal adaptation.

It’s a dire need in this age where Moore’s law is dead, but data keeps on increasing (seemingly) exponentially.
